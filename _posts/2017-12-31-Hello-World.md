It seems like everyone these days has a blog -- I'm officially joining the fray (maybe a decade or two late) 

I'll be using this as a space to post my data musings as I explore the world of data science through my own interests. It's mostly going to be learning and practice for me, so I'd of course appreciate any advice you have to offer :)

Stay tuned for a series of West Coast Swing data analyses!
